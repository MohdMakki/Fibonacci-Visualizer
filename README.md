# Fibonacci-Visualizer
# Fibonacci Sequence

A simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator.

## Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical pattern where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1, creating the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

This sequence appears frequently in nature, art, and various mathematical applications. It was introduced to Western mathematics by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in 1202, though it was known earlier in Indian mathematics.

## Features

- Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit
- Calculate the nth Fibonacci number
- Check if a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence
- Visualize the Fibonacci spiral

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fibonacci.git
cd fibonacci
```

## Usage

```python
from fibonacci import generate_sequence

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = generate_sequence(10)
print(fib_sequence)  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Applications

- Mathematical modeling
- Natural patterns in plants, shells, and galaxies
- Algorithm analysis and optimization
- Dynamic programming examples
- Golden ratio approximation
